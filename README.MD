# USB-C PCB Experiments

This is part of an ongoing series of projects involving creative interpretations of the USB mechanical standards. You've probably seen [2.0mm thick PCBs that fit in USB ports](http://digistump.com/products/1), and maybe you've seen [0.6mm thick PCBs that fit in USB-Micro cables](https://twitter.com/DHammarskjold/status/1285291152602796032). So what about USB-C? T​he plastic tab inside a USB-C port is about 0.7mm thick. I think [bobricius](https://hackaday.io/bobricius) has had success using 0.8mm thick PCBs; 0.6mm thick PCBs are way too loose. I haven't found a fab that will do 0.7mm (or 28 mil) PCBs unless you special-order an entire panel.​

So, what other ways are there to reach 0.7mm thickness? My original plan was to join an 0.1mm flex PCB and an 0.6mm FR4 PCB, but then I realized: you know what else is 0.6mm thick? The ATtiny84A BGA package. Granted, there are only contacts on one side of the PCB, but that shouldn't matter with the symmetric USB-C pinout, right? ...Right? (foreshadowing)

The 3mm-square ATtiny acts as a stiffener for the flex PCB, and it comes out to 0.7mm on the dot! I only have an imperial set of calipers as seen above. The dial shows 0.0275 inches, which is 0.6985 millimeters. ~~So this is looking pretty promising.~~ After [my initial tests](https://twitter.com/DHammarskjold/status/1476667605746270224), I am leaning toward a circuit sandwiched between two PCBs. The result is about 0.85mm thick with OSH Park flex PCBs, so I may need to locate another vendor.

What would you do with an ATtiny that lives inside your USB-C cable? I have a few ideas for demonstrations at the moment.

## Demo 1: RGB LED that can't be programmed over USB

There are two revisions of this design; the schematics are in the repo as `rgb_no_bootloader.kicad_sch` and `rgb_no_bootloader_r2.kicad_sch`. Revision 1 is the one that I have assembled and ready to work with, it's also the one I would like some code help with! My current code is in the in the code folder as `demo_1_revision_1`; it is saved as an Arduino .ino file but it should work fine with AVR-GCC without any changes.

This demo is as simple as possible: the microcontroller controlls an RGB LED that juuuust barely pokes out of the USB-C cable plug. It has to be programmed using that 8-pin FFC connector, and then the FFC connector has to be snipped off in order to use the dang thing. Right now I have one fully-soldered version of revision 1, ~~but I haven't cut the FFC connector yet because I would like some help improving the code.~~

Demo 1 Revision 2 is necessary because, on revision 1, the RGB LED is *not* connected to the Fast-PWM-enabled pins on the microcontroller. As a result I have to use [binary code modulation](http://www.batsocks.co.uk/readme/art_bcm_3.htm) to achieve any sort of brightness control. It's working alright, [as shown here](https://twitter.com/DHammarskjold/status/1475741148522049536), ~~but I'm not confident enough with the code to chop off the programming connector yet.~~

When I finally removed the connector, I documented it [in this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DHammarskjold/status/1476667605746270224). I got excited and tried putting it in a powered USB cable while the top side was exposed. Unsurprisingly, this caused some shorts and some damage! I soldered in a new RGB LED and applied conformal coating. The conformal coating helped for a little while, but got scraped away pretty quickly. This suggests to me that any future designs will need to be sandwiched between *two* PCBs.

As you can see, there is a large tab sticking out so I can grab and remove the PCB from the cable. However, out of spite for, uh, myself, I have labelled it the "cowards' tab." Past me was encouraging present me to remove that tab and make the board impossible to remove, thereby turning a useful cable into a cute little art piece for all eternity.

## Demo 2: ~~R~~GB LED that *can* be programmed over USB

It would be nice to use the USB data lines to program the microcontroller! I didn't attempt this for the first revision because I wanted to keep the board as uncluttered and simple as possible. It will result in a denser board that may need more careful soldering, but it should be possible! Well, *mostly* possible. I didn't find a way to route red green and blue at the same time, so I've omitted red from the design.

As I understand it, I need to add at least five extra components: a pullup for the D- line, small resistors on the D- and D+ lines, and zener diodes as level shifters. This is the low-complexity approach used on the Digispark and its derivatives. I have not attempted to make this board yet. Also, look at the 3d render above; doesn't it look like an owl? I love it.

There is an interesting issue, however. In the USB-C standard, the D+/D- lines are only connected on one side of the plug! It assumes that the USB-C port has D+/D- connectors on both sides, so the plug orientation should not matter. But our USB-C port only has D+/D- connectors on one side. We've reintroduced the classic USB behavior of having to flip the device over 3 times before it works!

## Demo 3: Basically a Digispark but smaller

In this version, the FFC portion is meant to stay attached! And all the components are 0402-sized with generous spacing so I can worry less when soldering. As a result it can be used in a slightly more "normal" fashion—still operable by sticking it inside a USB-C cable, but now there's a breakout of sorts.

## Demo 4: "Coulda used a 555"

On the Hackaday websites, "Coulda used a 555" is shorthand for grumpy commenters who criticize designs that they consider inelegant, for example, using a microcontroller where a 555 would suffice. In the past I've poked fun at this notion by, among other things, using *three* microcontrollers where a 555 would suffice, and using a 555 Schmitt Trigger where a single SPST button would suffice. As luck would have it, there is a BGA 555 IC that is just shy of 0.6mm tall! I've had to pair it with a 10μF capacitor that is a bit taller, but it's a fun idea to explore later.
